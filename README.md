# Fix WordPress Gutenberg Button Whitespace Issue

This function solves the problem of single spaces in button content being lost when saving posts in the Gutenberg editor. It replaces spaces with &nbsp; entities to ensure they're preserved in the database and displayed correctly on the frontend.

The function works by:
1. Extracting complete button blocks using WordPress comment markers
2. Examining each button to identify those with whitespace-only content
3. Replacing the whitespace with &nbsp; in the complete block
4. Maintaining the original HTML structure while only changing the content

## Usage
Simply insert it in functions.php.
